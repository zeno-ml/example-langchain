# Zeno ü§ù LangChain

This demo shows how to use Zeno to evaluate LangChain models.

To run it install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run `zeno config.toml`.

This example uses the [Notion QA example](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain-notion) over the Blendle Employee Handbook.

### Other LangChain models

To use on your own LangChain model, edit the prediction code in `model.py` and the validation data in `questions.csv`
